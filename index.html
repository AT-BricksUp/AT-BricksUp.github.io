                         <h2>Twitter to X: The Worst Rebrand in History?</h2>
                         <h3>Read Time: 4 minutes</h3>
                    </header>
                    <main>
                        <p>At first glance, calling the rebranding of Twitter to X "the worst rebrand in history" might seem like an exaggeration. But after more than a year since Elon Musk's controversial decision to rebrand one of the biggest social media platforms in the world, the facts tell a different story: a staggering 89% of brands still refer to the platform as Twitter.</p>
                        <p>On July 23, 2023, less than a year after Musk acquired the global social media giant, Twitter officially rebranded as X. The move was intended to signal a fresh start and to reassure stakeholders after a period of turmoil, including the dismissal of around 80% of Twitter’s long-serving staff. The familiar bluebird logo, synonymous with online communication, was replaced by a stark, almost anonymous letter: X.</p>
                        <p>More than a year later, the rebrand has yet to deliver the results Musk and his new leadership team anticipated. According to a report by Omnisend, which analyzed over 14,500 marketing emails from various brands, an overwhelming 89% of businesses worldwide continue to refer to the platform as Twitter. In countries like Italy and Spain, that figure climbs even higher, to 95% and 94%, respectively.</p>
                        <p>“The name change was likely a result of Elon Musk’s efforts to reinstate confidence among shareholders following a chaotic acquisition,” stated Pija Ona Indriunaite who is Brand Manager at Omnisend. “However, the fact that even businesses, which tend to be more precise communicators, still call it ‘Twitter’ shows that public acceptance of the rebrand is taking much longer than anticipated.”</p>
                        <p>“For 17 years, Twitter has woven itself into our daily lives, creating its own vernacular with terms like ‘tweet’ or ‘retweet’ that everyone gets, ‘re-Xing’ just doesn’t roll off the tongue. Plus, when ‘X’ is mentioned it reads like a placeholder rather than a brand name.”</p>
                        <p>The rebrand from Twitter to X illustrates more than just a failed identity shift—it highlights a lack of effective marketing and a fundamental misunderstanding of the platform's loyal users. While Musk may own the Twitter brand, he cannot strip away the elements that made its users feel connected and invested in the platform. The relationship between Twitter and its users was cultivated over the years and cannot be easily redefined or discarded.</p>
                        <p>Musk’s oversight in this regard has led to what many are calling the worst rebrand in history.</p>
                        <p> Amidst the continued chaos of this famous rebrand has come an incredible piece of marketing by WWF. The German branch of the World Wide Fund for Nature has collaborated with the advertising agency McCann Germany to create an extremely powerful marketing message. The image that WWF published showed the evolution of the Twitter logo from the original 2006 bird to the change in species and now to the very simple and lifeless X.</p>
                        <p>Not only does the graphic demonstrate the downfall of Twitter in recent years but also the catastrophic effects are ways are living are having on other species. The graphic signals what the future may look like for bird species, finishing with an X – the end and extinction of the birds’ habitat and therefore the overall species.</p>
                        <p>It’s ironic that a failed corporate rebrand has given rise to such a compelling message from an organization dedicated to saving the planet. As Twitter’s rebrand continues to stumble—or perhaps never truly take off—one can’t help but wonder about the future of the platform, especially with the emergence of Meta’s Threads and other challengers like BlueSky.</p>
                        <p>Twitter’s rebrand to X might go down in history, but not for the reasons Musk had hoped.</p>

                         <h2>Heinz Ketchup: It’s Okay to Break Design Rules</h2>
                         <h3>Read Time: 3 minutes</h3>
                    </header>
                    <main>
                        <p>Heinz has never been shy about breaking the mould when it comes to advertising, and their latest campaign is no exception. The iconic ketchup brand has launched an ad featuring their label turned upside down and distorted – a bold move that highlights the quirky, yet familiar struggle of getting every last drop of ketchup out of the bottle.</p>
                        <p>This campaign is designed to resonate with anyone who has ever had to shake, thump, or wrestle with a Heinz bottle. By flipping their logo, Heinz is embracing the reality that their ketchup is uniquely thick, often requiring a bit of effort to pour. Instead of seeing this as a flaw, Heinz is celebrating it, turning a minor inconvenience into a memorable and engaging piece of brand storytelling.</p>
                        <p>The advertisement, developed for Heinz’s unique out-of-home (OOH) marketing campaign, leverages this humorous take on product design to make a point: sometimes, it’s okay to break the rules, especially when it comes to something as beloved as Heinz Ketchup. The ad taps into the universal experience of using their product, ensuring that customers feel a connection to the brand's authenticity and playful nature.</p>
                        <p>With increased competition in the condiment industry with the likes of McCormick & Company Inc. and Conagra Brands Inc., it’s no surprise that Heinz are beginning to break the design rules. If there is one ketchup known for being so thick that you need to shake the bottle to get it out it's Heinz, and the company have played with that fact beautifully. The simple advertisement contains no tagline or pack-shot, instead, it's just a very simple message and idea that all Heinz users can relate to. The design is literally built on consumer behaviour!</p>
                        <p>Normally standard advertisements and billboards such as this one are taken for granted, blending into the busy, fast-paced working life around us. But Heinz have created an advertisement which not only does the user relate to, but also irritates them. It attracts the user because it breaks the design rules and creates an upside-down, blurred and distorted version of the iconic Heinz logo. All of this is a part of Heinz’s out-of-home (OOH) advertising campaign which focuses on advertising in common locations such as areas of high traffic, road junctions, highways, train stations, bus stops, airports, football stadiums and cinemas.</p>
                        <p>However, this isn’t the first time Heinz has played with their branding in a very clever way. From their famous upside-down bottle to the recent “Tattoo Bottle” campaign that offered fans a stencil for more accurate tattoos of the Heinz label, the brand consistently pushes creative boundaries. The brand even created its own phone case that had the perfect-sized compartment in the back to hold a single sachet of delicious Heinz tomato ketchup.</p>
                        <p>Ultimately, Heinz's latest ad is a testament to the power of design that doesn’t just follow the rules but redefines them. By flipping the script—literally—they’ve created a campaign that’s as thick with creativity as their ketchup is with flavour.</p>

                         <h2>The 5 Best Practices for Bringing a Brand to Life</h2>
                         <h3>Read Time: 5 minutes</h3>
                    </header>
                    <main>
                        <p>In today's dynamic marketing landscape, advertising alone is no longer enough. While creative campaigns may captivate audiences, many brands fail to maintain that magic when transitioning to the activation phase which involves actually bringing the brand to life on a personal and physical level. This disconnect can leave consumers with unmet expectations, diminishing the influence of both the brand and the product experience. So, how can businesses ensure the enthusiasm and effort behind their advertising is maintained through brand activations?</p>
                        <p>In this article, we explore the five best practices that can help brands successfully bridge the gap between advertising and activation, ensuring the promise made in advertisements is brought to life in every customer interaction.</p>
                        <p>1. Consistency is Key</p>
                        <p>One of the most common mistakes in brand activation is a lack of cohesion between the advertising campaign and the in-person or experiential activations. To create a seamless brand experience, the core message and visuals from a business’s advertisement must be replicated. This means that the colours, fonts, themes, and tones of their activations should all reflect the advertising campaign. By doing this, it reinforces the brand's identity and promise, ensuring that consumers recognize and connect with the brand at every touchpoint.</p>
                        <p>Take for example Coca-Cola's successful “Share a Coke” campaign. The activation allowed consumers to engage with the brand on a personal level by offering personalized bottles with names, echoing the emotional connection created in the original advertisements. This seamless consistency between advertising and activation was a major factor in the campaign’s global success.</p>
                        <p>2. Engage Multiple Senses</p>
                        <p>While advertisements are typically visual and auditory, activations offer an opportunity to create a more immersive experience. By incorporating multisensory elements like touch, taste, and smell, brands can establish more meaningful relationships with consumers. For example, a food brand may complement an advertisement with a live-tasting event, allowing customers to engage with the product in a more personal and memorable way.</p>
                        <p>Studies have shown that multisensory marketing can improve brand recall and consumer satisfaction (Zha, D. et al., 2024). By engaging the senses, businesses not only create a better experience but also help their audience form a stronger connection.</p>
                        <p>3. Include Consumers in the Story</p>
                        <p>Advertising often tells a story, but activations allow consumers to become a part of the narrative. Brands can bring their narratives to life by developing interactive experiences that reflect their advertisements. Whether through digital interfaces, live performances, or immersive environments, giving consumers the chance to engage directly with the brand can lead to a greater long-term impact.</p>
                        <p>A prime example of this is Nike's experiential pop-up stores, which offer customers the opportunity to try out products in real-life settings that reflect the athletic themes in their advertisements. By stepping into the brand's world, consumers are no longer just observers but participants in the brand experience.</p>
                        <p>4. Personalization is Powerful</p>
                        <p>Activations, as opposed to mass advertising, provide brands with the opportunity to tailor experiences to specific segments. By leveraging data-driven insights, brands can create personalized activations that resonate with their target audience. Whether through tailored messages, exclusive experiences, or one-on-one interactions, personalization can make consumers feel like the activation is made just for them.</p>
                        <p>This approach encourages brand loyalty in addition to strengthening the connection with consumers. Consider Spotify’s personalized activations around its annual “Spotify Wrapped” campaign. By making users the centre of the experience and showing them data unique to their personal listening habits, Spotify builds on the emotional bond created in the original campaign.</p>
                        <p>5. Have Clear Objectives</p>
                        <p>For brand activation to be effective and successful, it should be linked to clear, measurable objectives that align with the brand's broader goals—whether that’s boosting sales, increasing brand awareness, or enhancing brand advocacy. By measuring the performance of activations and gathering consumer feedback, brands can improve future campaigns and ensure they’re meeting both consumer expectations and business objectives.</p>
                        <p>Businesses like Red Bull excel in this area. Their extreme sports activations aren’t just visually spectacular—they also gather data on brand engagement, social media shares, and even retail impact. By tying their activations to measurable outcomes, Red Bull ensures that each event not only excites but also adds value to the brand.</p>
                        <p>Creating visually striking ads is no longer sufficient at a time when customers are increasingly demanding more from their interactions with brands. By following these five best practices, brands can ensure that the excitement generated during advertising translates into meaningful, engaging activations that bring the brand to life in the minds of consumers. Creating memorable experiences that are in line with a brand's story, values, and objectives is key to bridging the gap between advertising and activation.</p>
